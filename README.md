# albino 

binaural beats in the terminal


## what?

albino is a go program that generates binaural beats to make you feel funny. idk, it's probably a bunch of weird pseudoscience stuff but if you turn it on and start working it makes your head spin sometimes. i don't think it works as well as a drug would, but this stuff was everywhere in the 90's so it was a fun and nostalgic project.

## usage

to play one, run it with the name of the preset you want to use as an argument. 

for example:

```
./albino delta
```

or 

```
./albino inspiration
```

## presets

available presets are:

-  delta
-  theta
-  alpha
-  beta
-  gamma
-  confidence
-  relaxing
-  higherconsciousness
-  inspiration
-  clarity
-  stressrelief
-  calm
-  meditation
-  creativity
-  memoryrecall
-  luciddreaming
-  mindfulness
-  productivity
-  motivation
-  positiveenergy
-  anxietyrelief
-  innerpeace
-  positivity
-  focus
-  energy
-  relaxation

## how?

albino plays a sweeping sine wave with frequencies that correspond to the chosen preset. the frequency in each ear is moving in different directions, in opposition to each other. maybe your brain is just there resonating in the middle idk. each preset has a runtime of 30 mins.

## sigh

this thing is for fun and relaxation only, and isn't a substitute for medical advice or treatment. if you're one of those people who exagerates everything, talk to your doctor before using them. enjoy!
